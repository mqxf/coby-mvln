# coby-mvln
.coby/.mvln file language. We are going to make a compiler, assembler and linker. This is going to compile directly to linux binary executable.

Made by: mqxf and v22

The name mvln was used due to (mqxf, v22, language -> m, v, ln). However, .coby didn't seem taken as a file extension, so both .mvln and .coby are valid file extensions.
